# Local and Partial Density of states from VASP
Calculates PDOS (s,p,d,f) and LDOS (choose atoms) for required energy ranges

Requires only DOSCAR file

Also calculates sum of LDOS and PDOS for a given energy range: 

Please be careful to note that sum of TDOS shows the total number of states within a energy range; However, sum of PDOS and LDOS do not add up to TDOS as many states cannot be projected to the the orbitals or atoms in VASP
